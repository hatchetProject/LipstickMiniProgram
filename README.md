# LipstickMiniProgram
A Mini Program derived from the LipstickWebpage project.
In this project, the main algorithm is the same with the webpage version. The only changes are the framework and an additional recommendation algorithm. We transported it to the mini program version, which is developed by Weixin. The main difficulties met in this project were the construction of the Weixin interface and the combination of server and user's phones. Also, we intended to do user-specific recommendation, this brought challenges to the database and multi-threaded programming.

Unfortunately, this project only supports a preview version, as the server was not able to be set on time.

In the repository, the "dataset" file is not included due to its size. It contains the information crawled from the websites. But this should not matter, the dataset can be constructed by youself.
