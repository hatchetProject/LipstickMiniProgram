# LipstickMiniProgram
A Mini Program derived from the LipstickWebpage project.
In this project, the main algorithm is the same with the webpage version. The only change is the framework. We transported it to the mini program version, which is developed by Weixin. The main difficulties met in this project were the construction of the Weixin interface and the combination of server and user's phones. 

Unfortunately, this project only supports a preview version, as the server was not able to be set on time.
